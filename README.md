# Pink City

This is my personal site to display projects I've worked on! It is made with React, which is definitely overkill! One day maybe I'll convert this over to HTMX, but I know React pretty decently so this works, for now.

I call it pink city because it's _very_ pink.

## How I Ported My Font

I went through hell and high water to get this color font working across devices. You can read about it in this [guide I made!](./Porting-Colorfont-to-mobile.md)
